            <div id="textbox1">Front Street Cantina in Plainfield, IL serves fantastic authentic mexican 
            cuisine that keeps my family coming back for more.  Their chips and sala are always fresh and the
            portions are a good size but not huge.  The staff is friendly and attentive and we are always seated right away, have never had to wait. The best dish I have had there is the chicken enchilada.  They have great kid's meals and are very good about drink refills.  Their lunch specials make for an economical way to have a nice lunch out.  </div>

Also their beer and cheddar soup is out of this world!</span><span> They have weekly trivia nights and weekend bands with plenty of room to spread out.</span>
